from [https://scicomp.stackexchange.com/questions/11827/flop-counts-for-lapack-symmetric-eigenvalue-routines-dsyev-dsyevd-dsyevx-and-d]:

> First of all, yes, these are all based on an initial tridiagonalization (often quoted to be 43n3 flops). DSYEV is just an easier to use version of DSYEVX, so let's ignore it for now. The basic breakdown is such:
> 
> 
> - DSYEVX: Tridiagonal implicitly shifted QR (bulge chasing)
> - DSYEVD: Divide and Conquer (stitching by rank 1 modifications)
> - DSYEVR: Use the Multiple Relatively Robust Representations (MRRR) algorithm (symmetric dqds)
> 
> The flop count of each of these algorithms is highly dependent on the eigenvalue distribution. For example, if your matrix has clusters of closely packed eigenvalues that are nearly degenerate, then these algorithms tend to have reduced order of convergence. At best you have O(n2) flops in the tridiagonal eigenproblem, and at worst O(n3) if the sizes of your clusters go as O(n). See this working note for a more detailed analysis.
> 
> Since you want eigenvectors, let's look at the flop count for their extraction. Implicitly shifted QR continually updates the orthogonal matrices used for reduction, so it is always runs in O(n3) when eigenvectors are desired (basically, each QR bulge sweep takes O(n2), and you need to O(n) sweeps usually).
> 
> For D&C and MRRR, the textbook descriptions say to compute eigenvalues first, then extract eigenvectors with inverse iteration. This requires O(n) work per eigenvector since usually 1-2 iterations is enough, so it would be O(n2) work to get all the eigenvectors after the eigenvalues have been found. However, in practice, Lapack does something more sophisticated.
> 
> I'm not familiar with D&C, but look at the source, it looks like it keeps the eigenvectors updated as it goes, so it's runtime is likely somewhere between O(n2) and O(n3). For MRRR, the failure of inverse iteration has been analyzed in this paper. In practice, the eigenvectors must be updated throughout the algorithm and reorthogonalized when clusters are detected. A few of the details of this process can be controlled in the interface to DSYEVR, and like D&C, the practical runtime is somewhere between quadratic and cubic.

waw ... diagonalising a 6000x6000 matrix takes only 122s on one core of physix12, but if you attempt tu launch 32 of them simultaneously, they take between 263s and 401s...!  The only explanation I see is that they're fighting for cache.. let's try smaller matrices

# 20/08/2021

- with aviel, realized that the matrices are not the same, and that could make some diagonalizations faster than others. So I's added a fixed seed to ensure all computations are the same

- to see the effect of the cache on performance, I'll do computations on smaller matrices that will fit into cache memory (1Mb per core for xeon 6248r).
    - to do that I've added a loop argument to diag

graffy@physix90:/mnt/workl/graffy/bug3177$ export LOG_FILE=./run$(date).log; date > "$LOG_FILE"; for c in {1..2}; do echo "num cores : $c" >> "$LOG_FILE" ; OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 MKL_NUM_THREADS=1 ./diag_mkl_omp 128 10000 >> "$LOG_FILE" & done; wait ; date >> "$LOG_FILE"

```

## test xeon 6248r on physix96 

now that some of the xeon 6248r are available, I can launch benchmarks on one of them (as 6248r is the cpu that we are planning to purchgase if we choose intel)

```
graffy@physix96:/mnt/workl/graffy/bug3177$ ./cohab_batch.bash 48 physix96 10
